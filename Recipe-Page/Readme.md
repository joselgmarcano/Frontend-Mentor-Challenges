This challenge helped me focus on writing semantic HTML. Making sure to think about which HTML elements are most appropriate for each piece of content.

<h3 id='the-challenge'>The Challenge</h3>

The challenge was to create a recipe page using HTML and CSS in such a way that it was as close as possible to the original style. I took the opportunity to use an HTML header and semantics template I created for all future projects. I also used a template of CSS elements that will always be repeated.

<h3 id='what-i-learned'>What I learned</h3>

One of the most interesting activities that came my way in this challenge was adding CSS without any guidance or help. These types of projects help me have more creativity when applying styles to a website. This little challenge helped me better understand tables in HTML and I also learned how to add style to tables, something that I had not practiced until now.

<h3 id='continued-development'>Continued development</h3>

For future projects I want to go a little deeper into the design of tables in HTML and CSS, to have more practice on the subject. I also want to delve deeper into CSS.

<h3 id='useful-resources'>Useful resources</h3>
<p>The resources used for this project were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp' target='_blank'>Color Converter</a>: To convert different color formats into others, for example, convert HSL to Hexadecimal. Generally, I use it because I don't like using colors in HSL. It's a matter of personal taste. I'm not even a big fan of using RGB colors, unless it's strictly necessary.
