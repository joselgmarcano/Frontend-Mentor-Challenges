This is a solution to the <a href='https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm'>Recipe page challenge on Frontend Mentor</a>. Frontend Mentor challenges help me improve my coding skills by creating realistic projects.

<h3 id='the-challenge'>The Challenge</h3>
The challenge was to create a recipe page using HTML and CSS in such a way that it was as close as possible to the original style. I took the opportunity to use an HTML header and semantics template I created for all future projects. I also used a template of CSS elements that will always be repeated.
